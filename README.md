# Weather-AQI_Tracker

The Python script creates a Tkinter-based application focused on environmental information. Upon launching, the main window displays a logo, a random environmental fact from a predefined list, and a “Proceed to Application” button. When users click to proceed, they are prompted to enter a city name. The application verifies the city’s existence using the OpenWeatherMap API. If valid, it opens a second window offering options for Air Quality Index (AQI) information or detailed weather data. Selecting weather information retrieves and displays the current temperature, as well as the highest and lowest forecasted temperatures in Celsius, all presented with background images for enhanced visuals. The app incorporates error handling through message boxes, utilizes the PIL library for image management, and engages users with dynamic content, ensuring a user-friendly experience for accessing real-time environmental data.
